Frontend:

Create a web page that contains a comment feed with the ability to insert new comments and filter the existing comments. 
Use the attached design as a guideline for your web page.
To create the page, use one of the currently popular web application frameworks (such as AngularJS, Backbone.js, React, etc.)
The web page should include a form with 2 fields - email and message text fields - and a submit button.
The submit button should add a new item to the feed below the form.
The item that will appear in the feed should contain a gravatar photo (https://en.gravatar.com/) that matches the inserted email, the email and the message.
The web page should also include a filter area which allows the user to filter the items.
Use flexbox to construct the page layout


Backend: 

Implement a backend service that stores/retrieves the comments.
The service should be implemented in either Node.JS, Java or Scala.
Use either MongoDB or Redis as persistence layer.
